1.  **Language Foundation:** They provide definitive meanings, spellings, pronunciations, and etymologies of words, forming the bedrock of linguistic understanding.
2.  **Learning and Education:** They are indispensable for language learners, students, and anyone seeking to expand their vocabulary or understand complex texts.
3.  **Communication:** By standardizing word meanings, dictionaries facilitate clear and effective communication across different individuals and cultures.
4.  **Preservation:** They play a crucial role in documenting and preserving languages, including minority languages, ensuring their continued existence and study.
5.  **Cultural Insight:** Beyond mere definitions, they often offer insights into the cultural nuances and historical evolution of a language.
